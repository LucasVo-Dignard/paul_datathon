      "- **Impact on big clients:**  \n",
      "  *Delta’s existing corporate travel customers (e.g., Fortune‑500 firms, U.S. government agencies, and large travel‑management companies such as American Express GBT) will now be able to book passenger and cargo flights to Cuba for business meetings, conferences, and official visits that were previously prohibited. The removal of the embargo directly expands the itinerary options for these clients, generating incremental ticket‑sale and ancillary‑revenue opportunities.*  \n",
      "  *Rationale:* The bill lifts the U.S. travel ban to Cuba, so any pre‑existing contracts that include “any destination” or “global coverage” instantly become usable for Cuba‑bound trips, increasing the value of those contracts without requiring new client acquisition.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Impact on suppliers:**  \n",
      "  *Delta’s core suppliers – aircraft manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus), engine providers (GE Aviation, Rolls‑Royce), fuel distributors (e.g., ExxonMobil, Chevron), and in‑flight catering firms (e.g., LSG Sky Chefs) – will see higher utilization of aircraft and greater fuel consumption on the newly opened Cuba routes. This translates into additional production orders, maintenance work, and fuel sales tied to the incremental flight frequency.*  \n",
      "  *Rationale:* The ability to operate scheduled passenger and cargo services to Cuba creates new flight legs that consume fuel, require catering, and generate wear‑and‑tear on aircraft, directly benefitting the existing supplier base that already services Delta’s fleet.  \n",

      "- **Impact on big clients:**  \n",
      "  *United’s established corporate and government travel accounts (including large multinational corporations, U.S. federal agencies, and major travel‑management firms such as Carlson Wagonlit) will now be permitted to include Cuba in their travel itineraries. Existing contracts that cover “all‑airline” travel will gain added value, prompting higher booking volumes for business trips, diplomatic missions, and tourism‑related travel to Cuban destinations.*  \n",
      "  *Rationale:* The repeal of the embargo removes the legal barrier that previously forced these clients to route around Cuba or use alternative carriers; the bill instantly unlocks demand from the same client base that already purchases United tickets for other Caribbean destinations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Impact on suppliers:**  \n",
      "  *United’s current supply chain – aircraft OEMs (Boeing, Airbus), engine makers (GE Aviation, Pratt & Whitney), fuel suppliers (e.g., Shell, BP), ground‑handling providers (e.g., Swissport, Menzies) and catering services (e.g., Gate Gourmet) – will experience increased order flow and service demand as United adds Cuba to its schedule. More flight legs mean higher fuel purchases, additional catering contracts, and extra maintenance cycles for the aircraft operating the new routes.*  \n",
      "  *Rationale:* The newly authorized Cuba routes generate incremental operational activity that directly leverages United’s existing supplier relationships; no new suppliers are required, but the volume of business with each existing supplier rises proportionally to the added flights.  \n"
